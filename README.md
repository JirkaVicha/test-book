# React + Vite

This React app displays a list of books based on the Bible. It fetches book data from a local array and presents it in a list format. Users can view book details, read them online via provided links, and delete books from the list. The deletion process confirms with a user prompt. If no books are available, it prompts the user to upload books. The design is simple, focusing on displaying book information and providing basic functionality like deletion and online reading.
